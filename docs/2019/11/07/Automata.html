<meta name="description" content="Automata was a very interesting topic for me. It is not the first time I saw since I have taken the class (CIIC5045) and also seen it in my programming languages course. This topic is used in every area of computer science and in fact is the fundament of the whole science. The first programs where state machines that would do simple steps but would solve complex problems and would advance our world to what it is today. It has always been interesting to me since it was used to create computer science and is what could solve some of our biggest modern problems. Automata itself won’t solve the probles but it does show if they can be solved or not. As we have already seen with things such as math and logic. We need to analyze the states of a machine to prove if it is possible. The idea to a problem might be great but it might be impossible to execute and this is what state diagrams help do. Although Atomatas are used in computer science and to prove things it is also useful because it is very visual and for us humans it is way easier to see things visualized. If we wanted to run a whole program in our mind while reading the states of the machine we would easily get lost. With the visual aspect it is very easy to analyze." />
