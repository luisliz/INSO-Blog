<meta name="description" content="Time management is essential to any team and personal life. Most of the people in the world. Go about their day without structure and just do one thing at a time or multiple but not being efficient in any of them. For a project manager this is not an option. Everything revolves around time for the manager. They are the ones responsible to make sure the team meets the deadlines and everything is delievered on time and working properly. Since starting this class one of the practices that we did in our homeworks was to show our timelog for time worked on the project. This could include our personal life or just related to the class and project. The point that the professor had was to make sure we log time to get a feel for how much time a task may take to do. Humans are bad at time but even worse at estimating. We might think that cooking only took 2 hours but in reality it may have taken 5 and we wasted a lot of time without noticing. When we log time this is not a problem because we start to see real numbers and this makes us better at planning and estimating. For the first homeworks I didn’t log too strictly I just saw my schedule and esimated the time that I spent doing the other things. Just by doing that I noticed that I didn’t know where my time was going. It was all mostly a blur. I went to class did some homework, but didn’t notice that I spent 6 hours doing the homework because I got distracted and spent 3 talking. After noticing this I started logging all of my time and it has been a habit that has stuck with me. Now 90% of my week I have it logged and I know exactly what I was doing (or a very close approximation to it). From time logging I have learned how much time I really take doing tasks and a second benefit to this that I see is that I can tell that 15 minutes have passed since I interrupted my task and I feel desperate to get back to the task that I was doing. Hence making me more productive. The weeks that I was very mindful about every minute, I became so productive that there were days I literally had nothing else to do. This made me really happy. As the semester passed it hasn’t been as easy to stay improve, but I still keep logging time. From here on out I will keep time logging my time and will make sure to analyze at the end of the week. I think that doing this will be a very powerful combination for my future and can only bring positive things to my life." />
