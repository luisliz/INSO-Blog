As mentioned in the previous posts the goal for all of this is to have a plan and an accurate picture of what is the end goal and after that goal is rearched the plan on how to continue and continue appropriately. Nothing can be done in any of the engineerings without appropriate planning. In civil engineering for example, they have plans before they build something; Industrial engineering, have to constantly plan ahead, whach out for mistake and keep everything in line.

Software engineering compared to the other engineering specialities is realatively new. We are constantly building new systems to build different types of application and although there are many methodologies. Everyone has an opinion on what the best one is. For example, there is agile. A lot of the industries use this methodology and many think this is the standard for project management. Even though it is used by a grand majority in the modern time. It still has a long way to go before there is something definitive.

Logic and math is just the ground work for this. As mentioned in the syllabus there will be better specification of all this when we understand how to deal with Domains, automata and a few other tools which only help to improve the documentation and the planning process. Although all this could greatly improve the planning process there is still a lot of room left to go.
