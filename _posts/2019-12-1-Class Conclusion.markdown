### The Art of Learning
It has come to an end. I have grown as an engineer and as a person. From this class I integrated time logging and this has helped me keep track of my time to use it more efficiently. I am sure that as I grow professionally this will be an essential skill to constantly keep improving myself and avoid being plateaued. More than the specific things I have learned in my courses like a specific programming language or how an operating system works. I have learned the art of learning and how to be passionate about it.

To learn there are two very important things you need. Something that you like and can improve your life and organization. This is what the university provides because without university we could probably learn a lot of things, but we might ignore some things that we don't like but are very necessary. Like this course for example which a lot of us might think we don't need because we can "just get to coding and think about it on the way". This may work but the tools provided in the course allow us to do it the right way from the beginning. I see it more like teaching a soldier to survive with the bare minimum; sure, most of the time they'll have their guns, tools and everything they need but a great soldier will survive even in the middle of a forest with nothing but the clothing they have on.

I will be graduating soon and I will try to keep a lot of these tools in mind. I might not use a lot of them but since there are so many industries and so many types of managers and projects throughout my life which I might rotate through I will surely see tools like TLA+ which I had no idea existed. I think this course goes far and beyond to not keep things too introductory and really teaches us to use everything in a real way. Although I was lost for some parts of the course in the end I figured a lot of them out. The course can always keep improving so it is easier to understand specially when grading other students homeworks where I was lost since I didn't have a tight grasp of what I was grading. Just like our field which is rather new the course can keep improving until it is creating the most robust software engineers.
