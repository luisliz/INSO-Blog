More charts for visual people. After automata this was my favorite topic in the class. I am a very visual person so things like chats and diagrams are what really help me understand systems and the way their organized. I still like automatas more since they are basically the fundamental to everything that we do and that is very interesting to me. Although this is the case there is a need for different parts of a system. For example sequence charts show the way a system runs in respect to time. Other types of diagrams may show this too but it because of the way it's organized it's easier to quickly analyze what is going to happen next with a sequence chart.

The other type of diagram we learned about is the petri net. This also adds to the complexity and helps us get the details of a system by showing how one thing moves from one place to another. The benefit of petri nets is to show the specific transition and the amount of elements that will fall into this transition.

From the begining of time diagrams allow us to understand how the world works by looking at patterns. With the right chart a person who has no idea how a system works may give their input on their are of expertise without having to spend days, weeks or even months learning the details to then give input for a small area. Which brings us back to the importance of efficiency and constant improvement.
